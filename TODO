immediately:
* "Add a new bucket" should set focus on new bucket line
* check # and "select repayment options" links are out of whack when editing an event
* deleting sole event from account/bucket/tag perma results in ajax error
* make all autocompleting fields refresh their source array after event creation
* "payee" vs. "memo" is very, very confusing in deposit scenario
* some of the unicode icons are broken in Windows
* focus on appropriate field after revealing new sections/line-items in event form

before inviting other users to "beta test":
* README with installation instructions
* CHANGELOG

future
* spinner for ajax actions
* user info page (for password change)
* password reset from login page
* signup process
* exception notifier (?)
* /subscriptions index
* autocomplete actor field in event form
* better 404 and 500 error pages
* searching & reporting
* account reconciliation
* transaction templates ("saved" or "memorized" transactions)
* scheduled transactions (occur automatically at specified intervals)
* print stylesheet
* oauth authentication for API
* filter event views to show only events with a non-zero balance for the account in question
* filter event views to show only deposits, or only expenses
* normalize 'actor' so we can do actor-centric queries more efficiently
* full-text searching on the memo field
* show bucket and account balances next to names in drop-downs
* make bucket reallocation work from bucket perma
* support for multiple 'aside' buckets in a single account
