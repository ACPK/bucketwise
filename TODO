immediately:
* after saving a reallocation event, the line items don't reset
* green "your transaction has been recorded" notice doesn't disappear when starting a new event
* date column for event row is squashed in safari
* "Add a new bucket" should set focus on new bucket line
* check # and "select repayment options" links are out of whack when editing an event
* deleting event from account perma results in ajax error (maybe only when there is only a single event in the account?)

before inviting other users to "beta test":
* cache balances on events (?)
* make bucket reallocation work from bucket index
* make bucket reallocation work from bucket perma
* user info page (for password change)
* password reset from login page
* account rename
* tag delete (optionally move transactions to different tag, e.g. "tag merge")
* tag rename
* API
* validations
* rake tasks for user and subscription creation
* change style for event detail view: "window shade" style isn't really working
* spinner for ajax actions
* attr_protected everywhere (perhaps implement an update_override method or something for places where it would be useful to do mass updates despite protected attrs?)

before public release:
* signup process
* exception notifier (?)
* README with installation instructions
* /subscriptions index
* CHANGELOG

FIXME
* make all autocompleting fields refresh their source array after event creation

future
* autocomplete actor field in event form
* better 404 and 500 error pages
* searching & reporting
* account reconciliation
* transaction templates ("saved" or "memorized" transactions)
* scheduled transactions (occur automatically at specified intervals)
* show check numbers in event detail view
* add a memo field for events
* print stylesheet
* oauth authentication for API
* filter event views to show only events with a non-zero balance for the account in question
* filter event views to show only deposits, or only expenses
* normalize 'actor' so we can do actor-centric queries more efficiently
* full-text searching on the memo field
